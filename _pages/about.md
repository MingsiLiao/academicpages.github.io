I am a Ph.D. student in [Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology](https://gbcb.graduateschool.vt.edu/about.html) at the [Virginia Tech](https://www.dasc.vt.edu/) [School of Animal Sciences](https://sas.vt.edu/), advised by [Dr. Rebecca Cockrum](https://www.dasc.vt.edu/people/faculty/cockrum.html). My research focuses on leveraging **machine learning**, **bioinformatics**, **computer vision**, and **whole genome sequencing** to advance precision livestock farming and agricultural innovation.
