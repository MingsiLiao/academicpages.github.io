<p>
  Our research focuses on improving dairy calf management using advanced machine learning techniques like YOLOv8 for body weight prediction and diarrhea detection. This work integrates precision livestock farming with cutting-edge technologies.
</p>


<p>
  Key highlights of this project include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using depth images for accurate body weight prediction.</li>
  <li>Automated health monitoring through computer vision.</li>
  <li>Integration of genetic analysis with calf health data.</li>
</ul>
